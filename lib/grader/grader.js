// The grader — composes the loader and the check runners into the public API.
//
// Score formula matches the JS grader exactly:
//
//     score = max(0, 100 - sum(weight of failed checks))
//
// A 0-weight failed check still appears in `issues` (useful for advisory
// checks the UI surfaces without penalty) but doesn't move the score.
//
// Why deterministic (no LLM call) — repeating the rationale from the JS
// grader so future readers of this package don't relitigate it:
//   - Cheap (sub-millisecond per check), so we can grade before AND after
//     every rewrite for free, which feeds the "estimated_token_savings"
//     output of /api/rewrite.
//   - Reproducible: same prompt → same score every time. No sampling noise
//     polluting analytics.
//   - Auditable: every failed check has a regex you can read and argue
//     with. "Why did my prompt score 50?" → look at the issue list, look
//     at the rubric, change either if the answer is wrong.
